## Coding Notes
* Regime 2 has no updates from the last changes - it's not an interesting regime
* GD over learning rate, alphabet size functions are canceled - Future work-- they were not working properly
* First Regime and Third Regime- old capacity calculations are commented out- Not necessary now, current calculations are simpler and seems to be working fine
